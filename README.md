# apartment_regression
> NOTE: it has been almost almost two years since I made this small repo. If I were to replicate this study today, I would make different decisions for the engineered features, the model validation process and the visualizations used to communicate results. I'm keeping this repo public because I enjoy seeing how far I've come in a relatively short time. Thank you!
