# apartment_regression
> NOTE: its been almost almost two years since I made this small repo. Today I would make some different decisions in terms of the engineered features, the model validation process and the visualizations used to communicate results. That said I'm keeping this up because I like seeing how far I've come in relatively short time. Thanks!
